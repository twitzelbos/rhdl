# Foreword

It wasn't always so clear, but the RHDL programming language is fundamentally
about *empowerment*: no matter what kind of hardware you are designing now, RHDL
empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of
domains than you did before.

Take, for example, the work of "digital design": historically, it has been a
domain where only the most experienced developers would venture, and only with
years of caution and specialized knowledge. RHDL enables anyone familiar with Rust
to enter this space with confidence and speed up their learning curve in the process.

But RHDL isn't limited to attracting people to digital design work. It's equally
important for making hardware design more accessible to those who are already
comfortable with languages like Verilog, VHDL, or SystemVerilog. RHDL has taken on
the burden of decades of experience designing hardware description languages and
learned from their successes and mistakes.

That's what this book is about: serving as a bridge that gets you from the world
of software engineering into the realm of digital hardware design. You'll learn
not just about RHDL the language, but about the mindset and culture of hardware
designers. So welcome to the RHDL community—we're glad to have you here.
